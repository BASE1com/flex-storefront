# Flex Storefront
An open-source mobile app frontend for headless eCommerce built in Flutter.

The goal of this project is to help commerce professionals build mobile applications easily in order to unlock retail, B2B and B2C use cases.

This accelerator aims to significantly reduce development time for commerce applications by giving developers a head start on core components and features, while reducing the long term total cost of ownership thanks to development in a single codebase.

- **Works with any backend**. Flex Storefront's default integration is SAP Cloud Commerce (Hybris), but it is compatible with any backend that has an API.

- **Working eCommerce Storefront**. Flex Storefront delivers fully-working eCommerce storefront, with pre-built commerce flows and core features that follow UX best practices.

- **Fully customizable**. Compose your app with pre-built Flex UI - a Flutter widget library designed for eCommerce, or build your own theme from scratch.
